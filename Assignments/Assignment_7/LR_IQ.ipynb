    " * Binary classification models, especially with imbalanced datasets, can overfit to the training data. Cross-validation ensures the model performs consistently across different data splits.\n",

    "* It reduces the variance of the performance metric by using multiple subsets, giving a more reliable estimate of the model's generalization ability.\n",

    "3) Optimizes Model Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* During hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search), cross-validation ensures that the best parameters are chosen based on how well the model performs across folds, not just a single train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Handles Data Imbalance:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Stratified cross-validation ensures that each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset, leading to more meaningful evaluation in binary classification tasks."
