    "1) max_depth: Specifies the maximum depth of the tree.\n",
    "* Effect: Limits overfitting by preventing the tree from growing too deep, which reduces model complexity but may increase bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "* Effect: A higher value prevents small splits, increasing model robustness but potentially missing finer patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node.\n",
    "* Effect: Ensures leaves have a minimum number of samples, preventing overfitting and smoothing the decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "* Effect: Reduces model variance by limiting the features considered, making the model more robust to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) criterion: Determines the function to measure the quality of a split (e.g., gini or entropy for classification).\n",
    "* Effect: Affects how splits are evaluated and may lead to different decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) max_leaf_nodes: Limits the number of leaf nodes in the tree.\n",
    "* Effect: Simplifies the model by capping the number of leaves, reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) random_state: Controls the randomness of the estimator (e.g., for splits).\n",
    "* Effect: Ensures reproducibility for the same dataset."
